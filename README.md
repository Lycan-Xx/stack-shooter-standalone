## 🎮 What Makes This Different

**🏆 4 Leaderboard Types**
- **Global**: Compete with everyone worldwide
- **Subreddit**: r/gaming vs r/indiegaming - community pride

- **Weekly**: Consistent performance over time

**👥 Squad System**
- Create or join squads (teams within your subreddit)
- Individual scores combine into squad totals
- Squad vs squad competition
- Team leaderboards

**🎯 Daily Challenges**
- Same modifiers for everyone each day

- Creates shared experiences to discuss in comments
- Challenge-specific leaderboards

**� CommunDity Stats**

- Subreddit vs subreddit competition

### Why This Works on Reddit
